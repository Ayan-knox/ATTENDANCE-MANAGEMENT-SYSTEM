Itâ€™s a Python GUI (using tkinter library) integrated attendance system which will be
using face recognition for taking attendance . In this application , We have made an
attendance system which will use face recognition for taking attendance. It has been
integrated with GUI so that it can be easy for anyone to use it .  
  
Basically using a protected password students/employees which will be registered
and then they will be able to mark their attendance everyday on their own.  
  
Users during their first registration will be asked to take their images and those will be
used as training images, so next time whenever that user wants to mark his/her
attendance their present image will be compared to the saved images and then
attendance will be marked.  
  
If the attendance of a user is already marked and if the user forgot and again tried to
mark their attendance then it will show a message that attendance is already marked
and hence duplicates can be avoided.  
  
The password which need to be entered will be protected and can only be changed if
admin wants to change it through admin password check.
